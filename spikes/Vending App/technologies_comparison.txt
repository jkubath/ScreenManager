Web
    Pros:
        1. Fast development and prototyping
        2. Fast and easy UI
        3. Abundance of libraries and technologies for making clean aesthetically pleasing UI
    Cons:
        1. It must be run inside of a browser. Configuring the Firefox browser is time consuming and all features may not be possible.
    Options:
        HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.

Native
    Pros:
        1. Does not require a browser
        2. Where the team has the most experience
    Cons:
        1. Could have longest development time
        2. Will require integration of graphics / UI libraries
    Options:
        C++
            Pros:
                1. most resource efficient

            Cons:
                1. built-in UI is likely insufficient for the project's scope

Web compiled to native
    Pros:
        1. all the same pros as Web without the same cons
    Cons:
        1. resource inefficient (not an issue now, but may be one if in the future, if embedded or small, low resource computers are used).
    Options:
        Electron
            Pros:
                1. well and regularly maintained (active development)
                2. larger community than alternative
                4. good documentation
            Cons:
        NW.js
