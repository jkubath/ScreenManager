Windows OS

Pro's
	Windows handles the touch screen extremely well with only one bug (as noted below)

Con's
	Windows OS cost per license
	The issue with the touch screen listed below

Issue:
	When testing the Windows Operating System with our current touch screen.
	Any touch to the right side of the touch screen (about 1 inch from the right side) 
	will result in the touch will move the pointer to the top of the screen.  
	This throws off what the user was trying to touch.

	One work around could be to add a margin for that area of the screen, so
	that no browser would have a "working area" in that section of the screen.
