# Spikes directory

The spikes directory is to hold all the research done to make decisions
for the Screen Manager project.  Examples: how to embed a browser or 
how to control the size of a running application.


## Operating System Spike
Why our group chose to develop the project on Linux

## Screen Manufacturer
Contains a possible link to the touch screen manufacturer.
This is not certain as the screen has no branding and
we have not been given documentation on the screen.

## Touch Screen Troubleshooting
This directory contains all the testing that was done in
attempt to get the touch screen to function correctly.
