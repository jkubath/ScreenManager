This directory contains all of the research and testing that went into
creating the Touchscreen Interface Project.  It includes everything
that went into the final product as well as other ideas that came up
during the development process.  A few of them are getting the touchscreen
to work properly, choosing an operating system, and example code for
embedding a browser inside an application.

## App Controller
Allows you to specify where windows are located on the screen, how big they are,
and what you are allowed to do with them (Ex. Resize, Minimize, Exit, etc.).

## Browser Features
Limits what you are able to do in the Firefox web browser.

## Deprecated
Previous ideas that are not part of the final product.

## JavaScript Testing
Testing the browser against various forms of pop ups.

## Keyboard
Possibilities for a virtual keyboard to be used on the touchscreen.

## Operating System
Deciding to use an operating system of Linux vs. Windows.

## Touchscreen Calibration
Changes settings that deal with the horizontal/vertical coordination
of the touchscreen so that it works correctly in Ubuntu when changed
to a "vertical" format (short horizontally, long vertically).

## Vending App
Combination of a Vending Machine application that allows the user to
purchase items from the vending machine and an advertising section.

## Web Browser
Deciding to use a web browser of Firefox vs. Chrome.

## Screen Manufacturer
Contains a possible link to the touchscreen manufacturer, though it isn't
certain as the screen has no branding and we weren't given documentation
on the screen.
