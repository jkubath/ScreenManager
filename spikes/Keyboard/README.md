# Keyboard Directory

This contains documentation on virtual keyboards that we are looking to use with our browser.  Our goal is to find
one that would appear in the browser itself whenever there is any kind of text entry, but that is still movable by
the user.

## Onboard Virtual Keyboard

This keyboard comes with Ubuntu by default and is easily to enable with a few simple steps

## Chrome Virtual Keyboard

This is a keyboard feature that you can add to Google Chrome, but that unfortunately, doesn't work
on a touchscreen in terms of moving around the screen.
