When a device (computer) is connected to the touch screen, there is a property of the
Operating System that allows the touch screen to be rotated to show the correct
orientation.  This property is the Coordinate Transformation Matrix.  The issue
is that this matrix can become "Reset" to the identity matrix
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

The screen will appear to be rotated correctly, but the touch will not be.  This
will cause the touch capability to malfunction.  Setting this matrix to the values:
0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1 will calibrate the touch to the default up and down orientation 
of the kiosk touch screen.


To set the Coordinate Transformation Matrix
in Ubuntu run this command:

~$ xinput set-prop "pointer:E&T INC. E&T IR SCREEN" "Coordinate Transformation Matrix" 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1


An alternative to running the command is 
to run the set_xinput_matrix.sh shell script.

	Tip:	The shell script needs execution capabilities.
			This can be done with 
			~$ chmod 777 set_xinput_matrix.sh
