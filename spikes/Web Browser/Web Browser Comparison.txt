Google Chrome

	Pro's
		Widely used and highly trusted
    Has personal app store that contains several touch keyboard apps

	Con's
		No apps found that allow for input into the address bar
    Touch keyboards either require the user to open them whenever they want to use them
        or they open in inconsistent or hard to reach places (Ex. Open over text box
        where you're entering info; Always open at bottom of browser)

Mozilla Firefox

	Pro's
		Works great with the touchscreen.  The touch keyboard opens whenever any text area
        is tapped (address bar included) and repositions itself so that it isn't covering
        the area you're trying to type in
    Native to Ubuntu

	Con's
		Isn't as widely used of a browser (meaning there may be differences in what people
        are used to compared to other more commonly used browsers)
