# Web Browser Directory

This contains documentation on the Web Browsers we have considered using for the web browsing portion of
our touchscreen.

## Google Chrome

Has several apps made for it but they don't appear to work for everything.

## Mozilla Firefox

Works great with Ubuntu's built-in keyboard, Onboard.
