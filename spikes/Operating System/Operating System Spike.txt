Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

	Pro's
		Entire screen is usable as "Touch area"
		Wider range for application / development
		Accessibility (open sources and free)


	Con's
		Some setup / initialization is required

	Version Choice:
		Ubuntu 16.04 was chosen as it uses Unity as a screen manager by default.
		Ubuntu 18.04 uses a different screen manager.  Some core features that assist
		in limiting what the user can do from an OS perspective are removed in the
		new manager.


Windows OS

	Pro's
		Windows handles the touch screen extremely well with only one bug (as noted below)

	Con's
		Windows OS cost per license
		The issue with the touch screen listed below

	Issue:
		When testing the Windows Operating System with our current touch screen.
		Any touch to the right side of the touch screen (about 1 inch from the right side) 
		will result in the touch will move the pointer to the top of the screen.  
		This throws off what the user was trying to touch.

		One work around could be to add a margin for that area of the screen, so
		that no browser would have a "working area" in that section of the screen.
