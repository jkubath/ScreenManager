Restricting File Access

In Firefox, you have the ability to look through all of the files on the computer using file://
(as opposed to something like http://).  This means that if you wanted to see the files on the
desktop, you would simply type "file:///home/<username>/Desktop/" into the address bar.  From
there, depending on the Read, Write, and Execute restrictions on files, as well as what types
of files they are, you can view, open, save, and edit files.  This is a very useful feature when
you need a quick way to look at or edit things on your personal computer, but when it comes to
a public computer that anybody has access to, this is a tremendous security risk.  The following
are a list of features that could possibly be used to help diminish this risk:


NoScript

An add-on that allows you to put a variety of restrictions on what you are allowed to do in Firefox.
The name comes from the fact that you are able to reject anything that uses JavaScript.  It works in
terms of not showing the contents of directories, but still allows you to open or save documents if
you enter the full address (Ex. file:///home/<username>/Desktop/myCode.txt).

Block Site

An add-on that allows you to make blacklists and whitelists, but unfortunately, doesn't apply to
file:// addresses.

Public Fox

An add-on that is similar to NoScript in that it does allow you to prevent the user from seeing the
contents of directories, but still allows you to open or save documents if you enter the full address.

browser.tabs.remote.separateFileUriProcess

A preference in about:config that was implemented in Firefox 53 as a security feature.  By default,
it is set to true, but by changing its value to false, you remove the user's ability to access
local files using file://
