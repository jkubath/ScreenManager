Limiting Browser Features

The following are extensions for Firefox that provide different sorts of limitations on what the user can do:

1. Modern Kiosk 0.9 - Kiosk-like facility extension for modern browsers
    - Takes away the tool bar from Firefox
2. Public Fox - Block downloads, lock down bookmarks/addons/downloads with a password
    - Requires a login to access some of Firefox's features


We were also able to find that in Firefox 47.0.1, you are able to remove all the features outside
of the back, forward, and refresh buttons, the address bar, and tabs.  Then by creating a file (as
explained in the link below), you can remove the Main Menu (Hamburger) button, preventing the user
from accessing any of these features or doing other things.  These features can still be accessed by
pressing the Alt key, but this would just mean that we would have to disable use of the Alt key by
the user in general.  They can also be accessed through the Firefox Start Page (https://start.mozilla.org/firefox/)
so we would need to make sure that the user couldn't access that page.

After updating to Firefox 59.0.3, I found that most of these things remain the same.  One of the things
that has changed is the ability for users to access features through the Firefox Start Page, so we won't
need to worry about that.  However, the user does have the ability to change a variety of settings through
about:preferences pages.  The settings include General, Search, Privacy & Security, and Firefox Account, and
are accessed by entering about:preferences#general, about:preferences#search, about:preferences#security, and
about:preferences#sync, respectively, in the address bar.  The way to fix this would probably be to just
blacklist those addresses.


To do the above things in Linux, you simply follow some slightly different steps (found through the links
below).  The following is done to remove the "hamburger" menu button:
    1. In the Firefox browser, type "about:support" in the address bar
    2. Find "Profile Directory" and click "Open Directory"
    3. In the firefox directory, create a new directory and name it "chrome"
    4. Open the "chrome" directory, create a new document, and name it "userChrome.css"
        NOTE: "userChrome.css" should be the ENTIRE name, the file type is now .css, not .txt or anything else
    5. Open "userChrome.css" and paste the following text (this can also be found in the second post in the 
       ubuntuforums link below):
            
            @namespace xul url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);
    
            #PanelUI-menu-button { display: none !important; }
            
    6. Save "userChrome.css" and reopen Firefox

To remove the rest of the buttons, we'll modify the value of "browser.uiCustomization.state" in
about:config.  I've mentioned a way of doing this near the bottom of this page, which we'll have
to test out first, but if that works, we'll simply have to tell it to assign the current value of
"browser.uiCustomization.state" back to itself with several strings removed from the "nav-bar" section.



Unfortunately, preventing the user from accessing about: pages is not as easy as simply blacklisting
them.  I was able to find a way that uses similar steps to those that were used to remove the menu button.
The following steps (which can also be found in the links be below) are specifically for the about:preferences
page.  Below this, I have provided a piece of code that is simpler and can be applied to ALL of the about: pages:
    1. In the Firefox browser, type "about:support" in the address bar
    2. Find "Profile Directory" and click "Open Directory"
    3. In the firefox directory create a new directory and name it "chrome" (if it doesn't already exist)
    4. Open the "chrome" directory, create a new document and name it "userContent.css" (NOT "userChrome.css")
        NOTE: Once again, this should be the entire name, no .txt
    5. Open "userContent.css" and paste the following text (this can also be found in the ninth post in the
       first link below):
       
            @-moz-document url-prefix("about:preferences"),
            url-prefix("chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul") {
                .main-content:after {
                    content: "Sorry, preferences cannot be modified.";
                    font: 36px Arial;
                    margin-left: 5px;
                }
                #mainPrefPane {
                    display: none !important;
                }
            }
            
    6. Save "userContent.css" and reopen Firefox
    
In the second link, I have provided a list of all the about: pages that contains descriptions along with them,
meaning that if we wanted to prevent the user from accessing any of the about: features, we'd have to use
something similar to the code above on all of them.  If you just want a list of all the about pages, you can
go to about:about.

To clear all the content on the about: pages, preventing the user from accessing them:
    1. In the Firefox browser, type "about:support" in the address bar
    2. Find "Profile Directory" and click "Open Directory"
    3. In the firefox directory create a new directory and name it "chrome" (if it doesn't already exist)
    4. Open the "chrome" directory, create a new document and name it "userContent.css" (if it doesn't already exist)
        NOTE: This should be the entire name, no .txt
    5. Open "userContent.css" and paste the following text (part of this can also be found in the second post in the
       link below):
       
            @-moz-document url-prefix("about:"){body, page, window {display:none !important; }}
            @-moz-document url("https://www.mozilla.org/credits/"){body {display:none !important; }}
            
    6. Save "userContent.css" and reopen Firefox
    
NOTES: In the first line, "page" handles about:addons and about:preferences, "window" handles about:config
       and about:downloads, and "body" handles all the others except for about:credits.
       The second line handles about:credits, which is simply a list of all the people who have contributed
       to the development of Firefox.  Because of this, it isn't necessary, but it makes it clear that no
       about: pages are allowed.

Look into the second post in this link for information on how to access the Profile Directory
through the terminal (possibly allowing us to automate some of these steps):
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/239543/get-the-default-firefox-profile-directory-from-bash


To remove the user's ability to make videos fullscreen on Youtube or any other site:
    1. In the Firefox browser type "about:config" in the address bar
    2. Click the button that shows you saw the warning (Ex. "I accept the risk!")
    3. Find "full-screen-api.enabled" and double-click on it so that Value is "false"


To remove the user's ability to close all of their tabs:
    1. In the Firefox browser type "about:config" in the address bar
    2. Click the button that shows you saw the warning (Ex. "I accept the risk!")
    3. Find "browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab" and double-click on it so that Value is "false"

Look into the second link in the first post in this link (user.js) for information on how to
possibly create a file that will set the attributes talked about in the two sets of instructions
above (removing fullscreen videos and removing the closing of all tabs).  This will require the
other test I have posted above here (accessing Profile Directory through terminal) to work if
this will be entirely automated:
