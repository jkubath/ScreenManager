Limiting Browser Features

The following are extensions for Firefox that provide different sorts of limitations on what the user can do:

1. Modern Kiosk 0.9 - Kiosk-like facility extension for modern browsers
    - Takes away the tool bar from Firefox
2. Public Fox - Block downloads, lock down bookmarks/addons/downloads with a password
    - Requires a login to access some of Firefox's features


We were also able to find that in Firefox 47.0.1, you are able to remove all the features outside
of the back, forward, and refresh buttons, the address bar, and tabs.  Then by creating a file (as
explained in the link below), you can remove the Main Menu (Hamburger) button, preventing the user
from accessing any of these features or doing other things.  These features can still be accessed by
pressing the Alt key, but this would just mean that we would have to disable use of the Alt key by
the user in general.  They can also be accessed through the Firefox Start Page (https://start.mozilla.org/firefox/)
so we would need to make sure that the user couldn't access that page.

After updating to Firefox 59.0.3, I found that most of these things remain the same.  One of the things
that has changed is the ability for users to access features through the Firefox Start Page, so we won't
need to worry about that.  However, the user does have the ability to change a variety of settings through
about:preferences pages.  The settings include General, Search, Privacy & Security, and Firefox Account, and
are accessed by entering about:preferences#general, about:preferences#search, about:preferences#security, and
about:preferences#sync, respectively, in the address bar.  The way to fix this would probably be to just
blacklist those addresses.


To do the above things in Linux, you simply follow some slightly different steps (found through the links
below).  They are the following:
    1. In the Firefox browser, type "about:support" in the address bar
    2. Find "Profile Directory" and click "Open Directory"
    3. In the firefox directory, create a new directory and name it "chrome"
    4. Open the "chrome" directory, create a new document, and name it "userChrome.css"
        NOTE: "userChrome.css" should be the ENTIRE name, the file type is now .css, not .txt or anything else
    5. Open "userChrome.css" and paste the following text (this can also be found in the second post in the 
       ubuntuforums link below):
            
            @namespace xul url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);
    
            #PanelUI-menu-button { display: none !important; }
            
    6. Save "userChrome.css" and reopen Firefox

Unfortunately, preventing the user from accessing about: pages is not as easy as simply blacklisting
them.  I was able to find a way that uses similar steps to those that were used to remove the menu button.
The steps are as follows (and can also be found in the links be below):
    1. In the Firefox browser, type "about:support" in the address bar
    2. Find "Profile Directory" and click "Open Directory"
    3. In the firefox directory create a new directory and name it "chrome" (if it doesn't already exist)
    4. Open the "chrome" directory, create a new document and name it "userContent.css" (NOT "userChrome.css")
        NOTE: Once again, this should be the entire name, no .txt
    5. Open "userContent.css" and paste the following text (this can also be found in the ninth post in the
       first link below):
       
            @-moz-document url-prefix("about:preferences"),
            url-prefix("chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul") {
                .main-content:after {
                    content: "Sorry, preferences cannot be modified.";
                    font: 36px Arial;
                    margin-left: 5px;
                }
                #mainPrefPane {
                    display: none !important;
                }
            }
            
    6. Save "userContent.css" and reopen Firefox
    
In the second link, I have provided a list of all the about: pages that contains descriptions along with them,
meaning that if we wanted to prevent the user from accessing any of the about: features, we'd have to use
something similar to the code above on all of them.  If you just want a list of all the about pages, you can
go to about:about.
