# Browser Features

The Browser Features directory is for placing a variety of restrictions on what
the user is able to do in the Firefox browser.  It prevents the user from closing
all of the tabs, using features outside of the basic ones (Ex. Back, Forward, Home,
Refresh), accessing any of the about: pages, and more.
