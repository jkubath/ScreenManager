# TouchscreenInterface
Designing a touchscreen that is split into three sections: Web Browser, Vending
Machine, and Advertisements.

## build
This directory contains all of the source files for the touchscreen interface
(in non-executable form), with testing files and research documentation removed.

## deploy
This directory contains the executable, data files, and shell scripts needed
to run the application.

## docs
This directory contains all of the side information that is relevant to the
Touchscreen Interface Project, including things like legal documents, NDAs,
programming standards, and version control.

## spikes
This directory contains all of the research and testing that went into
creating the Touchscreen Interface Project.  It includes everything
that went into the final product as well as other ideas that came up
during the development process.  A few of them are getting the touchscreen
to work properly, choosing an operating system, and example code for
embedding a browser inside an application.
